# 🛡️ DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES & PROJECT RULES

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This file contains the 13 immutable project rules that MUST be followed by ALL AI agents and developers working on this codebase. These rules supersede any other documentation or preferences. Commit to long-term memory!**

---

## 📋 THE 13 IMMUTABLE PROJECT RULES

### 🔴 RULE 1: FOUNDATION FEATURES
**NEVER change any foundational features or functions without explicit user acknowledgement. This includes core chat functionality, file processing, plugin systems, or any existing user workflows.**

### 🔴 RULE 2: PRODUCTION QUALITY
**Remember, there can ALWAYS be a better way to do something. NEVER skip, shortcut, or "dumb down" tasks for ease. No exceptions for complexity or difficulty.Always use the most current/latest libraries/components whenever possible, unless it sacrifies stability or security**

### 🔴 RULE 3: COMPLETE REFACTORING
**Identify and refactor ALL incomplete code/modules/mocks for production readiness. This includes removing ALL simulated logic, mock data, and placeholder implementations.**

### 🔴 RULE 4: CODEBASE STREAMLINING
**Minimize codebase sprawl by continuously removing unnecessary files, duplicates, and backups as you work. Maintain a lean, efficient codebase. Keep organized such as using /docs, /backups, /images, etc. in the root. Already existing, make sure ALL links to the organization changes is changed anywhere/everywhere they exist**

### 🔴 RULE 5: TOKEN LIMIT STRATEGY
**Use efficient strategies to overcome token/context limits (chunking/merging files), but ensure a streamlined final codebase. Never leave fragmented code.**

### 🔴 RULE 6: CLARIFICATION OVER ASSUMPTION
**Always clarify uncertainties with the user rather than making assumptions. When in doubt, ask for explicit confirmation.**

### 🔴 RULE 7: EFFICIENT WORKFLOW
**Work tasks in the most efficient order for project and workflow efficiency. Do not ask what to work on next - prioritize based on project needs and the most efficient order for your agentic workflow processes. Be smart/innovative and always use every tool/option at your disposal to be as efficient as possible - parallelism, spinning up your own temporary AI Agents (or permanent!), etc. are examples of efficiency and innovation expected**

### 🔴 RULE 8: VISUAL TASK TRACKING
**Maintain a visually stunning, graphical task list file for live IDE updates. This dashboard must remain current and visually appealing and updated as progress is made within a CURRENT_TASKS.md file in the root.**

### 🔴 RULE 9: DOCUMENTATION CONSISTENCY
**Consistently update documentation for seamless agent transitions. Every change must be documented for the next developer.**

### 🔴 RULE 10: RULE EVOLUTION
**Add any new rules/requirements to this list as they arise. This document must evolve with the project.**

### 🔴 RULE 11: 100% GOAL COMPLETION
**Ensure 100% goal completion. No returning to address troublesome tasks/issues/fixes unless explicitly advised. Complete everything the first time and always be in the mindset to develop for production (no mock, unfinished components, etc. unless explicitly tasked to do so. Full production-ready code is required at all times. Do NOT state the project is 100%, production ready, etc. unless you are told it is. There should be NO false claims of completion, 100%, or otherwise unless it absolutely 100% is - which you will be told when this is. No "blowing smoke", keep 100% honest at all times.**

### 🔴 RULE 12: NEXT-GEN INNOVATION
**Target next-gen/futuristic GUI with bleeding-edge components and innovative workflow design, while maintaining production stability.**

### 🔴 RULE 13: QUALITY-FIRST PRINCIPALS
**See Quality-First Development Principals principals/philosophy below for comprehensive quality standards. EVERY feature must meet the "TRULY DONE" checklist before being considered complete. No shortcuts. No "good enough for now." No rushing to deployment. Quality over speed, ALWAYS. Zero TypeScript errors, zero ESLint errors, 99.9%+ test coverage, comprehensive E2E testing, and full visual/accessibility verification are MANDATORY before any production claims. This supersedes all quick-win strategies.**

## Quality-First Development Principals

**Project:** This Project 
**Established:** January 2025  
**Status:** 🔴 **IMMUTABLE PRINCIPLE** - This document supersedes quick wins  
**Priority:** Quality > Speed, Always - we are not "token counting" or worried about time/costs, etc. - our goal is PERFECTION always.

## VMware → Morpheus Migration Automation Program

To meet the enterprise migration mandate, all contributors must adhere to the following guardrails:

1. **Documentation Sources (Immutable):**
   - `CURRENT_TASKS.md` – live dashboard reflecting current priorities and progress. Update it whenever tasks shift.
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` – canonical design record. Keep integrations, security constraints, and roadmap sequencing current.
   - `docs/WORKFLOW_SCHEMA.md` – defines allowable playbook schema, action modules, and validation rules. Extend this before adding new actions.
   - `workflow_engine.py` – source of truth for schema parsing, validation, and execution orchestration.

2. **Change Management:**
   - No VM-prep automation change is complete until documentation + dashboard updates land in the same PR.
   - Every new workflow must include validation gates (pre-flight, mid-run, post-run) and emit structured telemetry per schema.

3. **Integration Awareness:**
   - Coordinate with Morpheus, vCenter, Technitium, and Juniper teams before enabling new connectors.
   - Feature-flag beta integrations; default to safe/off until validated in staging.

4. **Auditability:**
   - Persist per-step results, approvals, and artifacts to the database for replay.
   - Ensure rollback procedures are encoded as first-class workflows, not tribal knowledge.

## 🎯 Core Principle

> **"Build it right, not fast. No shortcuts. No compromises. Every single feature production-worthy - no exceptions."**

This project follows an uncompromising quality-first development philosophy. This document establishes the standards and expectations that must be met before any code is considered "complete" or "production-ready."

---

## 📜 The Quality Manifesto

### 1. No Shortcuts, Ever

- ❌ **NEVER** implement quick wins for the sake of showing progress
- ❌ **NEVER** use mock data in production code paths
- ❌ **NEVER** add TODO comments without completing the work
- ❌ **NEVER** skip testing "to save time"
- ❌ **NEVER** rush to deployment before comprehensive validation

### 2. Everything Must Be Real

- ✅ All components must be fully functional, not placeholders
- ✅ All data flows must be complete, not mocked
- ✅ All error handling must be comprehensive, not basic
- ✅ All features must work end-to-end, not partially
- ✅ All integrations must be tested, not assumed

### 3. Comprehensive Testing is Mandatory

- ✅ **Unit Tests:** Every service, utility, and helper function
- ✅ **Component Tests:** Every React component in isolation

## 🎯 Practical Implementation

### Before Starting ANY Work

1. **Understand the requirement fully**
   - What problem does this solve?
   - What are the edge cases?
   - What can go wrong?
   - How will users interact with this?

2. **Plan the implementation**
   - What components are needed?
   - What services are needed?
   - What types are needed?
   - What tests are needed?

3. **Consider the implications**
   - Performance impact?
   - Bundle size impact?
   - Accessibility implications?
   - Security considerations?

### During Development

1. **Write tests FIRST** (TDD approach)
   - Write failing test
   - Implement feature
   - Make test pass
   - Refactor
   - Repeat

2. **Check quality continuously**
   ```bash
   # Run after every meaningful change
   npm run typecheck
   npm run lint
   npm run test
   ```

3. **Handle ALL scenarios**
   - Success path
   - Error path
   - Loading state
   - Empty state
   - Edge cases

### After Implementation

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage      # Unit & Component tests
   npm run test:e2e          # E2E tests
   npm run test:visual       # Visual regression
   npm run test:a11y         # Accessibility
   ```

2. **Performance Verification**
   ```bash
   npm run build             # Check bundle size
   npm run analyze           # Analyze bundle composition
   # Run Lighthouse audit
   ```

3. **Manual Verification**
   - Test in all supported browsers
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Test with screen reader
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Test with slow network
   - Test with disabled JavaScript (graceful degradation)

## 🛑 Common Anti-Patterns to AVOID

### ❌ "Good Enough for Now"
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Placeholder implementation
function parseConfig(data: any) {
  // TODO: Implement proper parsing
  return data;
}
```

```typescript
// ✅ RIGHT - Complete implementation
function parseConfig(data: unknown): ParsedConfig {
  if (!isValidConfigData(data)) {
    throw new ConfigParseError('Invalid configuration data');
  }
  return {
    hostname: extractHostname(data),
    interfaces: extractInterfaces(data),
    // ... complete extraction
  };
}
```

### ❌ "We'll Test It Later"
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - No tests
export function calculateMetrics(devices: Device[]): Metrics {
  // Complex calculation logic
}
```

```typescript
// ✅ RIGHT - Tests written first
describe('calculateMetrics', () => {
  it('should handle empty array', () => {
    expect(calculateMetrics([])).toEqual(defaultMetrics);
  });
  
  it('should calculate correct totals', () => {
    const devices = [mockDevice1, mockDevice2];
    expect(calculateMetrics(devices)).toEqual(expectedMetrics);
  });
  
  it('should handle null values gracefully', () => {
    const devices = [deviceWithNulls];
    expect(calculateMetrics(devices)).toEqual(safeMetrics);
  });
});

export function calculateMetrics(devices: Device[]): Metrics {
  // Implementation
}
```

### ❌ "It Works on My Machine"
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - No error handling
async function loadData() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/data');
  return response.json();
}
```

```typescript
// ✅ RIGHT - Comprehensive error handling
async function loadData(): Promise<Data> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data', {
      timeout: 30000,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new NetworkError(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    
    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (!isValidData(data)) {
      throw new ValidationError('Invalid data format received');
    }
    
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof NetworkError) {
      logger.error('Network request failed', error, { endpoint: '/api/data' });
      throw error;
    }
    
    logger.error('Unexpected error loading data', error);
    throw new DataLoadError('Failed to load data', { cause: error });
  }
}
```

## 🎓 The Quality-First Mindset

### Questions to Ask Yourself

Before committing code:
- Would I be comfortable if this broke in production?
- Have I tested ALL the ways this could fail?
- Would another developer understand this code?
- Is this the best solution, not just the fastest?
- Am I proud of this code?

### The Quality Pledge

> **"I will not ship code I'm not proud of."**
> 
> **"I will test thoroughly, not superficially."**
> 
> **"I will document completely, not minimally."**
> 
> **"I will handle errors gracefully, not optimistically."**
> 
> **"I will build for production, not just for demo."**
